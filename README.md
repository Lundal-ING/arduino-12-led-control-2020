# Arduino 12 LED Control (2020)

This was my very first Arduino project, completed in September 2020 during high school (Data Electronics/Data elektronikk).

The goal was to control 12 individual LEDs connected to digital pins 2–13 on an Arduino Uno.

## Hardware

- Arduino Uno
- 12x LEDs
- 12x 220Ω resistors
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- USB cable

---

## Wiring Overview

- LEDs connected to digital pins 2–13
- Each LED uses a 220Ω resistor for current limiting
- All grounds connected to Arduino GND

The resistor is placed in series with each LED to prevent excessive current.

## Technical Concepts Demonstrated

- Digital output control
- Current limiting with resistors
- Basic circuit wiring on breadboard
- Understanding polarity of LEDs
- Sequential timing using delay()

## Historical Note

This project represents the starting point of my embedded systems journey before beginning my Electronics Engineering degree.

The code is intentionally kept in its original 2020 form.
